title: Key / Seed Generation
file: 101-KeySeedGeneration


category: Cryptographic Asset Management

description: >
 This aspect covers the generation of cryptographic keys and seeds that will be used within a cryptocurrency system. The secure creation of cryptographic keys and seeds requires two things to be secure: privacy and un-				guessable numbers. Privacy is required to ensure that the newly created keys or seeds are not read/copied by an unintended party. Un-guessable numbers are required to ensure the newly created key cannot be guessed or 				determined by an unintended party. Each of the goals listed below provide assurance that the keys and/or seeds are created in a private and un-guessable manner.

level_one:
  - The cryptographic keys and seeds are created by the actor who will be using it. This ensures privacy of the key as the only person/system that will ever hold it is the one that will use it. Any system that involves one actor creating a key or seed and then giving it to another actor for use will fail to achieve Level I.

level_two:
  - The key or seed generation methodology is validated prior to use. Software that is used to generate seeds should be free from any features that restrict the generated seed to conform to deterministic values, or features that store or transmit the generated seed to another party. Once this assertion has been made, a digital signature should be validated prior to each use to ensure the software has not been altered since it passed its security audit. In cases where keys or seeds are created without the use of software (i.e. dice, a deck of cards, or other non-digital means), the creation methodology should be validated to ensure determinism is not present (i.e. there are no weighted dice, each card in the deck is unique, etc.) 

level_three:
  - The key or seed is generated using a Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG) that conforms to NIST SP 800-90A, and has been seeded with at least two separate cryptographically secure sources of entropy that have been combined in a cryptographically secure manner (i.e. SHA256[UnguessableFactor1 + UnguessableFactor2]). NIST SP 800-90A is a standard that ensures that deterministically-generated numbers follow a random distribution with respect to a deterministic seed. Thus, the ability to determine these random numbers lays in the ability to discover the DRBG’s seed.
  - Optionally, instead of a NIST SP 800-90A compliant DRBG with a combination of two seeds as specified above, the key or seed may also be generated by a Non-deterministic Random Bit Generator (NRBG), or a “True Random Number Generator” (TRNG) that passes industry-standard statistical tests for randomness such as Diehard, Crypt-X, or NIST STS.
